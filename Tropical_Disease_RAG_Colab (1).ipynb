            "🤖 Answer: Based on the provided case studies, here are descriptions of tuberculosis cases:\n",
            "\n",
            "1. Case-41: The 32-year-old Malawian man with a history of HIV infection and previous tuberculosis presents with symptoms of painfully swollen neck, productive cough, chest pain, weight loss, fevers, and night sweats. His diagnosis includes tuberculous lymphadenitis, superimposed bacterial lymphadenitis, and Immune Reconstitution Inflammatory Syndrome (IRIS) of the paradoxical type. This case highlights the reactivation of tuberculosis in a patient with HIV infection despite being on antiretroviral therapy.\n",
            "\n",
            "2. Case-22: The 26-year-old Malawian woman with a history of HIV infection presents with symptoms of headache, confusion, and unilateral ptosis, leading to a diagnosis of tuberculous meningitis. This case illustrates the extrapulmonary manifestation of tuberculosis affecting the central nervous system, which can be particularly severe and life-threatening.\n",
            "\n",
            "Unfortunately, there is no specific tuberculosis case described in Case-50 involving the Peruvian farmer with chronic paracoccidioidomycosis and thrombocytosis. This case focuses on a different fungal infection rather than tuberculosis.\n",
            "\n",
            "In summary, the provided case studies offer insights into the diverse clinical presentations and complications of tuberculosis in individuals with underlying conditions such as HIV infection and immunosuppression.\n",
